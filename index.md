Racical phone has skin that feels your pinch

This project is related to mine because this is one of the material and technology that can be used to build the robot car, such as it can sense the user action and react. It can sense pinch, pull, ticliing etc. Each action can be used to assign different function. This can save a lot of spaces for buttons and control unit. In my design, I might be able to achieve this by use the buttons or something simliar to the replicing project the fruit keyboard by turning other material to a button to make action to the micro bit.

UI lit by the light in your room

This project is related to mine because this is the technology that can be used in the interior design in the car. Sometime we might find ourseleves consistantly adjusting the light in and outside the car. With this technology, the light will adjust itself by the environment. I think I can put this in my design using the light sensor in the mirco bit to dim and lit up the light.

Interactive Mario Mushroom Block

This project is related to mine because it used the acceleration sensor to activate an action. In my design concept, I want to use the acceleration sensor to trigger some action as well. Plus I can reference the use of the material since it look simple but effective and it is something I can build at home.

Change RGB LED Connected to ESP12E from Web Page Using Knob

This project is related to mine because it is a new way to control the color of the light. In one of my design concept, I want the user to able to control the light by the information recieved from the sensor. He used node MCU as his control module which in my case, I can use the micro bit. This inspired me a different way to let the user to control it. It might not need to be the exact same method but this apperantly could be a way out.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

https://www.mantralabsglobal.com/blog/10-basic-principles-of-interaction-design/
This actile is about the basic principles of interaction design. I used this principles to remind myself when I designing the final product. I found some of these principles very useful especially the affordability and functional minimalism. Sometimes I was a bit greddy and I want to put as much function in one design as I can but then it will be too complicated and messy, making it hard to use. So I learned to break it into different part and simplify the design. 

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*
Improve the user experience of the car 

### Design concept 1 ###
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*
The first concept I want to put in the design is using the light sensor to achieve some action. I know there is some simliar excisting design out there but for this one I want to do more than automaticlly turn the light on and off I want the user have a choice, by add the button function I will let the user the choice the color of the light they intended to turn on.  
### Design concept 2 ###
The second concept I want to put into the design is use the acceleration sensor to warn the user they are going too fast. Most of the accident on road is cause by the unwareness of the driver. It doesn't matter if the car is safe in emergency, the best way to prevent it is avoid the getting into danger situation .

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
